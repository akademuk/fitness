# Elite Fit - Premium Landing Page

This is a high-performance, premium landing page for an Elite Fitness Club, built with modern web technologies.

## Features

- **Premium Design**: Minimalist, luxury aesthetic with focus on typography and imagery.
- **Smooth Experience**: Implements `Lenis` for buttery smooth scrolling.
- **Animations**: `GSAP` ScrollTrigger animations for engaging content reveal.
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices.
- **Theme System**: Built-in theme switcher to preview different color palettes and font pairings.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure.
- `css/style.css`: All styles, including the CSS Variable-based theming system.
- `js/main.js`: Main logic for sliders, scroll, and menu.
- `js/theme-switcher.js`: Developer tool for toggling themes (can be removed in production).

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the **Theme** button in the bottom right corner to switch between different luxury themes (e.g., Gold Luxury, Midnight Blue) and font pairings.
3. The site uses CDN links for libraries (Swiper, GSAP, Lenis) and Fonts for immediate preview. For production, these should be downloaded locally.
