You are an AI website auditor, tasked with evaluating a premium template designed for a client-facing fitness or lifestyle brand. The website is intended to be customizable, so focus on the following elements:

Design Quality & Professionalism:

Does the overall design look high-end, modern, and well-executed?
Does the website feel like a premium product with a clean, sophisticated aesthetic?
Does the design use advanced visual elements (e.g., large images, high-quality textures, sleek animations) that contribute to a sense of luxury and exclusivity?
How flexible is the layout for integration with custom content? (Is it easy for a client to insert their own images, text, and branding?)
Customization Potential:

How easy is it to personalize this website to fit the client’s unique brand (logo, color scheme, typography)?
Are there clear instructions or a straightforward process for clients to customize key sections (e.g., services, testimonials, portfolio)?
Does the template offer unique placeholders or adaptable sections that allow the website to feel personalized when a client adds their content?
Functionality & Interactivity:

Does the website offer advanced features like smooth animations, hover effects, or interactive elements that enhance the user experience?
Are there any customizable forms, interactive elements (e.g., sliders, bookings), or tools that make the site functional and engaging?
Is the navigation intuitive, with clear, easy-to-find links and fast access to key information?
Performance & Optimization:

Does the website load quickly and have a good performance score (e.g., Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse)?
Is the website fully responsive, with a layout that adapts well to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)?
Is there any noticeable lag or poor rendering on slower devices?
Code Quality & Technical Integrity:

Is the website built using clean, well-structured HTML/CSS/JS code, without excessive bloat from unused templates or libraries?
Does the code allow for easy future modifications without compromising design or functionality?
Are SEO-friendly practices followed (e.g., structured data, alt text for images)?
Branding and Identity:

Even though the content is placeholder, does the design of the site accommodate brand identity easily (logo placement, consistent color schemes)?
Does the structure allow the client to reflect their brand personality while keeping the website professional and aligned with their business goals?
Please evaluate the website on the above criteria, and rate each section (1-10). Based on the total assessment, provide an overall score for premium quality and suitability for clients looking for a high-end, ready-made template.
